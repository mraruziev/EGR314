## Overview
Purpose of having block diagram is to help visualise my subsystem so that you can understand the workflow better. I have included 2 motors that are going to be parallel on the right. 2 motors on the left will also work together as parallel. I have planned to make the rover working with 2 motors together on each side, then making chassis as my stretch goal. This block diagram clearly shows how power, control and data will be floweing through my subsystem and to make the whole rover system work. Mobility of the rover is crucial to successfull launch of the project.

Things to mention are following:
* Power levels: Unregulated power levels are going to be 9V for the motors, but the input to ESP 32 is 3.3V. For logic-level peripherals of my subsystem's ESP 32 I will use 3.3 volts. <br>
* Actuator: I will be using 4 same DC motors for smooth operation of the rover. <br>
* Team connections: I will be connecting my ESP32 to Caleb's board to oeprate better through RX and TX <br>
* Power source: barrel jack for the motors are main sources of power. <br>
