The table includes threshold and target measures for each requirement. The rover's mobility is key, and ensuring that the motors and wheels support the upper body is crucial. Each requirement is important for the proper operation of my subsystem, ensuring it not only works properly but also meets EGR 314 criteria. Motor drivers require 9V, so my subsystem needs an additional power source. I have also included an additional column to show if the measure stretch requirement is met. The target measure is ideal for my motor, PCB, and power system.</p> Requirement description Measure of threshold Target measure Stretch requirement (Y-N) Surface-mounted, 3.3 V switching regulator 3.2 Volts Stable 3.3 Volts No Surface-mounted microcontroller for mobility control 1 PIC18F or ESP32 ESP32 No Wireless communication through UART Able to send or receive data with at least a wireless communication subsystem Send and receive Wi-Fi Data to MQTT to all subsystems Yes Consumption of power Motors, motor driver, and PCB do not heat up too much Meets power budget guidelines No Low-voltage DC motors 4 Brushless DC motors 2 brushless DC motors can hold and move the upper body of the rover No Motor driver L298N motor driver No overheating in the test window No Shared power for motor Module runs well with pin header Consistent power without need to change source No The motor moves forward and back All wheels turn on flat surfaces No slipping and works well on hard surfaces too No Motor turns right and left 2 motors on the left and 2 on the right turn together and move, staying in the  same place The steering system works, and the 2 motors work with better-controlled movement Yes 4 Wheels Wheels are good enough to hold the rover Wheels operate well and have stable alignment No Mechanical constraints Fits within a decided shape Clean mounting of motors to the PCB No"},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Module's Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Purpose of having block diagram is to help visualise my subsystem so that you can understand the workflow better. I have included 2 motors that are going to be parallel on the right. 2 motors on the left will also work together as parallel. I have planned to make the rover working with 2 motors together on each side, then making chassis as my stretch goal. This block diagram clearly shows how power, control and data will be floweing through my subsystem and to make the whole rover system work. Mobility of the rover is crucial to successfull launch of the project.</p> <p> </p> <p>Things to mention are following: * Power levels: Unregulated power levels are going to be 9V for the motors, but the input to ESP 32 is 3.3V. For logic-level peripherals of my subsystem's ESP 32 I will use 3.3 volts.  * Actuator: I will be using 4 same DC motors for smooth operation of the rover.  * Team connections: I will be connecting my ESP32 to Caleb's board to oeprate better through RX and TX  * Power source: barrel jack for the motors are main sources of power. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#asadbeks-block-diagram","title":"Asadbek's Block Diagram","text":"<p>Showing my screenshot of the block diagram here</p> <p></p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Module's Selected Major Components","text":""},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#modules-selected-major-components","title":"Module's Selected Major Components","text":"<p>The following sections are the selected major components necessary for  .....</p> <p>For each of the following sections, use one of the two styles given near the end.
